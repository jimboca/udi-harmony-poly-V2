    This is the class that all the Nodes will be represented by. You will add this to
    Polyglot/ISY with the controller.addNode method.

    Class Variables:
    self.primary: String address of the Controller node.
    self.parent: Easy access to the Controller Class from the node itself.
    self.address: String address of this Node 14 character limit. (ISY limitation)
    self.added: Boolean Confirmed added to ISY

    Class Methods:
    start(): This method is called once polyglot confirms the node is added to ISY.

        This sets the driver 'ST' to 1. If report is False we do not report it to

    reportDrivers(): Forces a full update of all drivers to Polyglot/ISY.
